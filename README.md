## Data Visulaization -week 7
---
visualization is summed up in three key points:

. Simple

. Consistent

. Concise


Visualizing data gives meaning when your audience can understand your data at a glance. 

So, its not really about you, that is why the three points above should guide you in your data visualization.



The third point (concise), is very key, as "less is more", which is what our tutor Saviour Henry illustrated in our last class. 



Depth is very important, in fact that is where you showcase your data visualization skills:



. Adding legends

. Adding labels

. Formatting grid lines

. Changing the data fonts and colors

. Renaming the titles



All of these make the difference.



What is even more important in all these is knowing the right chart to use and when to use them. Here's how:



. When the goal is to make comparisons, use Bar chart.

. When the goal is to monitor trends and progressions, use Line charts.

. When the goal is to illustrate proportions, use Pie charts.

. When you want to reveal relationships between variables, use Scatter plots.



. Histogram is to show data distribution, while Heatmaps emphasizes data density and connections- I'm still figuring these two out. 



So, here's what I learned last week in my 3MTT program.
